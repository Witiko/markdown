Here is a note reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]
This should *not* be a note reference, because it has not been
defined.[^my note]

[^longnote]: Here's the long note. This one contains multiple blocks.

    Subsequent blocks are indented to show that they belong to the
note (as with list items).

          { <code> }

    If you want, you can indent every line, but you can also be
    lazy and just indent the first line of each block.

This paragraph should not be part of the note, as it is not indented.

  [^1]: Here is the note. It can go anywhere after the note
  reference. It need not be placed at the end of the document.
