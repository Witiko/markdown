Here is a note reference[^1] and another.[^longnote]
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to
write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and
move down to type the note.]
  
[^1]: Here is the note.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
  
    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous note.
  
        Some code

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
