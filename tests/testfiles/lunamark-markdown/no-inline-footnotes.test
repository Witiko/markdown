This test ensures that the Lua `inlineNotes` option is disabled by default.
The following inline notes should resolve to notes.

^[Here is the note.  It can go anywhere after the note
reference.  It need *not* be placed at the end of the document.]

\^[This should *not* be a note, because it has been escaped.]
