\markdownSetup{texComments=true}
<<<
This test ensures that the Lua `texComments` option correctly propagates
through the plain TeX interface.

The following *emphasi%  this is a comment
  zed text* should be uninterrupted, whereas this *emphasi\%  another one
zed text* should be interrupted.

The following *emphasi% this is a comment

  zed text* should be broken into two paragraphs.

A single backslash at the *end of \
a line* should be allowed by the preprocessor.

Two backslashes at the *end of \\
a line* should also be allowed by the preprocessor.

Three backslashes at the *end of \\\
a line* should also be allowed by the preprocessor.

The surjective preprocessor should allow us to express `\\%
` and `\\\%`, `\\\\%
` and `\\\\\%`, etc. by having each pair of backslashes preceding a percent
sign become a single backslash.

On the other hand, any backslashes not preceding a percent sign should stay
unaltered by the preprocessor: `\text{Hello world}!\\`

Here is a corner case: `\\` separated by a comment: `\\%
\`.
