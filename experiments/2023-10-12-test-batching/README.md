This directory contains experimental code for measuring the speed impact
of test file batching added in [pull request #316][1]. The results of the
experiment are available in the Jupyter notebook document
[`speed-tests.ipynb`][2] and have been published in a TUGboat article
titled [*Fast regression testing of TeX packages: Multiprocessing and
batching*][3].
