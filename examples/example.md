Here is a note reference[^1] and another.[^longnote]
Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to
write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and
move down to type the note.]

[^1]: Here is the note.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous note.

        Some code

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph notes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.
