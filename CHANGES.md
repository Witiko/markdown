  rather than a bold-italic font face.

  will recognize HTML elements, entities, instructions, and comments in the
  input.

  blockquotes can be split apart using blank lines.

Documentation:

  backported to and merged by the
  [upstream project](https://github.com/jgm/lunamark).
- The unit test templates now use M4 instead of ad-hoc sed string replacement.
- The Lua text buffering routine was removed as it only introduced complexity
  to the package with no tangible benefits. All text buffering is now done in

  `\markdownLuaUnregisterIBCallback` macros have been deprecated.

  [Pandoc spec](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations).

  working directory, so that the cache files are not sought in the TeX
  directory structure.

Documentation:

- Added information about the portable use of the package.

Development:

- All the syntax extensions (fenced code blocks and citations) were merged by
  the [upstream project](http://github.com/jgm/lunamark).

- Added the package to a continuous integration service.

## 2.0.0 (2016-08-15)

New features:

- Added raw unescaped URI to the `link` and `image` renderer arguments.
  (This breaks backwards compatibility, hence the major version number bump.)
- Added renderers for plain TeX and ConteXt special characters.

Fixes:

- Make autolinks work by preventing `Str` from consuming `<`.
